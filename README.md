# SPC Chart

Welcome to the **KensoBI SPC Chart** panel for **Grafana**. This plugin enables you to easily create statistical process control (SPC) charts, including **Xbar-R**, **XbarS**, and **XmR** charts. It automatically calculates and displays control limits, with options to add your own custom limits. Additionally, you can group your samples into subgroups and aggregate them using methods such as **moving range**, **range**, **mean**, or **standard deviation**.
